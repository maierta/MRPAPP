# MRPAPP

The MRPA++ computer code simulates neutron scattering and 
superconductivity in correlated electron systems. It uses 
a random-phase approximation (RPA) / Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) 
theory to predict the neutron scattering cross section of realistic 
multi-orbital tight-binding models with Hubbard-like electron-electron 
interactions for the normal and superconducting states. It can also be 
used to calculate the pairing interaction in these models using an RPA 
approximation and to predict the superconducting gap structure.
